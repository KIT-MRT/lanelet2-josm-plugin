"""Every scene of one city: where they are, without opening their sensors.

KITScenes keeps no city column anywhere (`data/sequence_archives.csv` has
id, split, archive and size). What it does keep is `maps/origin.json` in
every scene, which is the city's projector origin, and the scene's own
trajectory. So a scene belongs to whichever of the dataset's three cities its
first pose lies nearest to. Each scene is placed through its *own* origin, so
scenes would still line up if two origins in one city ever differed.

Only `poses.txt`, `origin.json` and `timestamp.reference.txt` are read here:
opening a scene's sensor loader costs far more than this whole index, and a
city has hundreds of scenes.

On a network mount every file operation is a round trip (~130 ms to the
dataset's CIFS share), and the files are a few kB, so the index is pure
latency: one after another, 1650 scenes would take ~11 minutes. Hence the walk
runs in a thread pool, never asks about a file it is about to read anyway,
and what it read is kept in a local cache (`IndexCache`), so a restart only
lists the splits and reads the scenes it has not seen.
